# Shepherd GitHub PRs

Pick the `agent:needs-work` PRs that can be worked on now, and give each to `shepherd-github-pr`. This skill never polls: a PR whose checks are still running is skipped, and a later run picks it up.

**Read first:** the `github-workflow-protocol` skill (`.agents/skills/github-workflow-protocol/SKILL.md`), then its `references/labels.md`, `references/log.md` and `config.env`. If you have a shell, `source scripts/agent/lib.sh`.

## Process

1. **List candidates.**

   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open --label agent:needs-work --limit 100 \
     --json number,title,createdAt,labels,isCrossRepository --jq '
     def names: [.labels[].name];
     [ .[] | select((names | any(. == "agent:stuck")) | not)
           | {number, title, createdAt, fork: .isCrossRepository} ] | sort_by(.createdAt)'
   ```

2. **Select.** Oldest first, apply `shepherd-github-pr`'s **Eligibility** (check state and lease) to each, and keep the first `$SHEPHERD_BATCH` that pass. Skipped PRs do not count toward the batch.
3. **Dispatch** each selected PR to `shepherd-github-pr` (see **Dispatching** in the protocol). Collect each result line.
4. **Log it.** One run-log entry (`references/log.md`): each item's result and any **Problems**. Nothing eligible: log `nothing eligible` and stop.

## Never

- Shepherd a PR yourself, or claim one. Only `shepherd-github-pr` claims.
- Wait for CI to finish.
- Merge, approve or review. `review-github-prs` does that.
