# Shepherd GitHub PR

Take one PR from "opened" to "reviewable": get checks green, address open review findings, then post the handoff. This skill never polls. If checks are still running, it skips the PR and a later run picks it up.

**Input:** a PR number `N`.

**Read first:** the `github-workflow-protocol` skill (`.agents/skills/github-workflow-protocol/SKILL.md`), then its `references/labels.md`, `references/handoff.md`, `references/escalate.md`, `references/log.md` and `config.env`. Also `.agents/docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`. If you have a shell, `source scripts/agent/lib.sh` and `git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks`.

## Eligibility

Check this first. If it fails, claim nothing and return `#N skipped: <reason>`.

- `N` is an open PR labelled `agent:needs-work`, without `agent:stuck`.
- If it carries `agent:in-progress` and `lease_live N` succeeds, someone has it: skip.
- Check state is `failing` or `green`. Read it like this (ignore the command's exit code, which is non-zero while checks run):

  ```bash
  gh pr checks N --json bucket --jq '[.[].bucket]
    | if length==0 then "no-checks-yet" elif any(.=="pending") then "pending"
      elif any(.=="fail" or .=="cancel") then "failing" else "green" end'
  ```

  `pending` or `no-checks-yet`: skip. It will be eligible on a later run.

## Outputs

- Fix path: push a commit and post an attempt comment ending with `<!-- agent:attempt step=shepherding sha=<new head SHA> -->`. The PR stays `agent:needs-work`.
- Ready path: a "ready" handoff comment ending with `<!-- agent:handoff kind=ready sha=<head SHA> -->`, then swap `agent:needs-work` → `agent:ready-for-review`.
- Escalation to `agent:stuck` when attempts reach `$MAX_SHEPHERD_ATTEMPTS` or the PR is a fork (`references/escalate.md`).
- Lease released.

## Process

1. **Claim.** `claim N pr agent:in-progress Shepherding "$LEASE_TTL_PR"`. Release on every exit path from here on: fixed, handed off, escalated or failed.
2. **Fork check.** `gh pr view N --json isCrossRepository`. If true, follow `references/escalate.md` and stop.
3. **Decide what is needed:**
   - Checks `failing`, or `open_findings N` is above 0: go to step 4.
   - Checks `green` and `open_findings N` is 0: go to step 5.
4. **Fix.**
   1. If `shepherd_attempts N` is at least `$MAX_SHEPHERD_ATTEMPTS`, follow `references/escalate.md` and stop.
   2. Read the failing logs (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`) and, if `open_findings N` is above 0, the newest `kind=review` handoff comment. If you cannot read enough of the failing output to find the cause, do not guess: release, and return `#N failed: cannot read failing output`. This does not count as an attempt.
   3. Check out the PR branch and fix the cause. Run the narrowest relevant test first, as `AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` says.
   4. **Never edit tests, snapshots or allowlists to make a check pass.** If a test looks wrong, say so in the attempt comment and leave it.
   5. Push. Post a short comment on what you tried, ending with `<!-- agent:attempt step=shepherding sha=<new head SHA> -->`.
   6. The PR stays `agent:needs-work`. Do not wait for the new checks. Go to step 6.
5. **Hand off.** Post the "ready" handoff on the PR, as `references/handoff.md` describes (changes, decisions, risks, verification, reviewer focus). The comment must end with `<!-- agent:handoff kind=ready sha=<head SHA> -->`. Then in one command: `gh pr edit N --remove-label agent:needs-work --add-label agent:ready-for-review`.
6. **Release.** `release N pr agent:in-progress`.

## Result

Return one line: `#N fix pushed`, `#N ready-for-review`, `#N escalated: <reason>`, `#N skipped: <reason>` or `#N failed: <reason>`. When a group skill called you, it logs the result. When you were run on your own, write a run-log entry for it (`references/log.md`).

## Never

- Wait for CI to finish.
- Merge, approve or review. `review-github-pr` does that.
- Apply `agent:ready-for-review` while checks are not green or findings are open.
