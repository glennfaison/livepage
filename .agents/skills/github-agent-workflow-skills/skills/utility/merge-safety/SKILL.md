# Merge safety

Give an evidence-based merge-gate assessment. This is not a substitute for a
full code or security review, and it does not authorize or perform a merge.

## Workflow

1. Establish the exact PR, base and head, then inspect the complete diff and
   relevant callers or contracts. Read the linked issue when it clarifies the
   intended behavior.
2. Check GitHub readiness from the PR itself: draft status, mergeability,
   required checks, and required reviews. Treat the PR description as a claim,
   not proof that checks or review passed.
3. Assess compatibility:
   - Identify affected public APIs, routes, serialized or exported formats,
     persisted data, schemas, defaults, configuration, and external consumers.
   - Compare the old and new behavior. Decide whether existing users and
     artifacts continue to work without changes.
   - Treat an addition as breaking if it changes an existing contract or
     invalidates existing data or consumers. A new option or catalog entry is
     not breaking merely because it adds behavior.
   - A breaking change needs an explicit compatibility or migration plan and
     evidence that the transition is tested. Block on an unplanned or
     unverified break.
4. Assess reversibility:
   - Determine whether the change can be reverted after deployment, not just
     whether its diff is small or `git revert` is conflict-free.
   - Trace state or artifacts the change may create: database writes,
     migrations, exported files, user-authored content, URLs or asset
     references, and effects on external systems or consumers.
   - State the rollback path and whether rollback leaves data, references, or
     consumers stranded. Rate removal blast radius as low, managed, or high,
     with evidence. A high or unknown blast radius needs a tested rollback or
     recovery plan; otherwise block.
5. Report a verdict. Use **PASS** only when compatibility and reversibility
   have no unresolved blocker and GitHub readiness requirements are satisfied.
   Use **BLOCK** for a concrete safety failure. Use **HOLD** when evidence is
   missing, checks or reviews are pending, or the PR is still a draft. Do not
   turn uncertainty into a pass.

## Report

```text
Verdict: PASS | BLOCK | HOLD
Breaking changes: None | <finding and evidence>
Reversibility: Low | Managed | High | Unknown — <rollback path and evidence>
GitHub readiness: <draft, mergeability, checks, required reviews>
Blockers or next steps: <specific actions, or None>
```

Link findings to exact files and lines or to the relevant GitHub status. Keep
compatibility risk, rollback risk, and GitHub readiness separate so a green
check suite cannot hide a breaking change or an unsafe rollback.
