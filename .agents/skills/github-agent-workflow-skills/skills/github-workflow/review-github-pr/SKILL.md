# Review GitHub PR

Review one PR and merge it if an agent can safely do so. If not, record why and, when the fix is small, fix it.

**Input:** a PR number `N`.

**Read first:** call the Skill tool with `github-workflow-protocol`, then read these files in that skill's directory: `references/labels.md`, `references/handoff.md`, `references/escalate.md`, `references/log.md` and `config.defaults.env`. If you have a shell, follow **Shell setup** in the protocol and, if `$GIT_HOOKS_PATH` is set, run `git config core.hooksPath "$GIT_HOOKS_PATH"`.

## Eligibility

Check this first. If it fails, claim nothing and return `#N skipped: <reason>`.

- `N` is an open, non-draft PR labelled `agent:ready-for-review`, without `agent:stuck`.
- If it carries `agent:in-progress` and `lease_live N` succeeds, someone has it: skip.

The head SHA must match `ready_sha N` and checks must be green. Step 4 enforces that after you claim.

## Inputs

- The PR title, body, comments and linked issue(s). The `merge-safety` and `code-review` skills run against the pinned SHA.

## Outputs

- Mergeable: merge pinned to the reviewed SHA (`gh pr merge N --match-head-commit "$SHA" --"$MERGE_METHOD"`). For each linked issue, remove `agent:pr-open` and close it with "Implemented in #N."
- Not mergeable: an optional small fix (no design decision, only code this PR already changes), a "review" handoff ending with `<!-- agent:handoff kind=review sha=$SHA open=<unfixed count> -->`, and a swap `agent:ready-for-review` → `agent:needs-work`.
- Escalation to `agent:stuck` if `review_rounds N` is at least `$MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS` or the PR is a fork.
- Lease released.

## Process

1. **Claim.** `claim N pr agent:in-progress Reviewing "$LEASE_TTL_PR"`. Release on every exit path from here on: merged, sent back, escalated or failed.
2. **Pin the head.** `SHA=$(gh pr view N --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)`. Everything below applies to this commit and no other.
3. **Fork check.** If `isCrossRepository` is true, follow `references/escalate.md` and stop.
4. **Confirm the state is true.** If checks are not all green, or `ready_sha N` is not equal to `$SHA` (someone pushed after the handoff), the PR is not ready. Swap `agent:ready-for-review` for `agent:needs-work`, release, and stop for this PR. `shepherd-github-pr` will re-verify.
5. **Review.** Read the PR title, body, comments and the linked issue. Call the Skill tool twice, for `merge-safety` and for `code-review`, both against `$SHA`.
6. **Decide.**
   - **Mergeable.** Merge pinned to the reviewed commit: `gh pr merge N --match-head-commit "$SHA" --"$MERGE_METHOD"`. If someone pushed meanwhile, the merge fails: do not retry. If your tools cannot pin a merge to a commit, re-read the head SHA immediately before merging and stop if it is not `$SHA`. Then, for each issue `M` printed by `issue_for_pr N`: `gh issue edit M --remove-label agent:pr-open` and `gh issue close M --comment "Implemented in #N."`. GitHub normally closes the issue itself from `Closes #M` when the PR merges into the default branch (`develop`). Close it explicitly anyway: it does no harm if already closed, and it covers a PR whose body lacked the keyword. Done.
   - **Not mergeable.** Continue to step 7.
7. **Not mergeable: fix what is small, record the rest.**
   1. If `review_rounds N` is at least `$MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS`, follow `references/escalate.md` and stop. Do not start another round.
   2. Fix only findings that need **no design decision** and touch code this PR already changes. Check out the PR branch, run the narrowest relevant test first, push. **Never edit tests, snapshots or allowlists to get green.** Flag them instead.
   3. Post the "review" handoff, as `references/handoff.md` describes: each finding, whether you fixed it, and what remains. End the comment with `<!-- agent:handoff kind=review sha=$SHA open=<number of findings still unfixed> -->`.
   4. In one command: `gh pr edit N --remove-label agent:ready-for-review --add-label agent:needs-work`. This applies whether or not you pushed. After any push, checks must run again before the PR can be reviewed again.
8. **Release.** `release N pr agent:in-progress`.

## Result

Return one line: `#N merged`, `#N sent back: <open findings>`, `#N escalated: <reason>`, `#N skipped: <reason>` or `#N failed: <reason>`. When a group skill called you, it logs the result. When you were run on your own, write a run-log entry for it (`references/log.md`).

## Never

- Merge in the same run in which you pushed a commit. A fresh review run must review the new head.
- Merge anything other than the pinned `$SHA`.
- Retry a failed merge in the same run.
- Merge a fork PR, a draft, or a PR labelled `agent:stuck`.
